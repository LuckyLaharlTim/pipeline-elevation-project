Remote Sensing (RS), Cloud Computing (CC)

1) work on obtaining clipped data images of Texas (RS,CC)
2) export images to 
	a.	Cloud Storage (CC)
	b.	Drive (RS, if necessary)
3) Develop an elevation prediction Deep Learning model (RS)
4) Make a cloud function/workflow out of #3 Python script(s) (CC)
5) Report/Visualize model accuracy (RS)
6) Make maps of predictions (CC, RS as needed)
	a.	Convert likely Raster pixel assignments to vector features
	b.	Combine with joined pipeline info (operator, etc.)
	c.	Combine with derived pipeline info (shape length, etc.)
	d.	Make maps
